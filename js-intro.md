# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
a function is a factory. it includes a declaration, a call, an argument, and directions on how to process the argument. 
"Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that 
performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it."

#### 2. What is a method?

A method is a function within a class.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?

String methods perform methods within a string. examples are:

.indexOf()
.charAt()
.endWith()

etc.

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?

Accessors provide access to an object's properties by using the dot notation or the bracket notation. A mutator permanently modifies the array.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

Console.log is only used for debugging/informative purposes. Return is used for returning values from a function directly. 

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

I really like all of the time we have on challenges. I also really like learning all of the long-form building blocks that 
lead up to a big picture. It helps to avoid just learning shortcuts.
